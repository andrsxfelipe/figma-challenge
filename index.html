        <h2>About Metallica</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Metallica is an American heavy metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, although they have resided in
                San
                Francisco for most of their career. It consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, drummer
                Lars Ulrich, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Metallica is considered one of
                the
                most commercially successful bands of all time, with over 125 million albums sold worldwide. It was
                founded
                in 1981 in Los Angeles by Ulrich and Hetfield, who were later joined by Ron McGovney and Dave Mustaine.
                In
                1982, McGovney left the band and was replaced by Cliff Burton. The following year, Mustaine was fired
                due to
                behavioral issues and was replaced by former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett. In 1986, while on tour,
                Burton
                was killed in a bus accident in Sweden, leading Jason Newsted to join the band. In 2001, Newsted left
                the
                band and was replaced by Robert Trujillo in 2003.

            <p>
                Metallica's 1983 debut album, "Kill 'Em All," is the band's debut album and a cornerstone of thrash
                metal. It fuses influences from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal with the energy of punk, creating a
                work that marked a before and after in the metal scene.

                "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by Metallica is a song based on Ernest Hemingway's novel of the same name. The
                lyrics describe the harshness of the Spanish Civil War and a soldier's reflections on death and war. The
                song has also been interpreted as a commentary on the futility of war and the connection of all human
                beings. In live versions, the song often begins with a bass solo as a tribute to Cliff Burton, the
                band's original bassist.

                "Master of Puppets," both the song and the album, are recognized for their message about addiction,
                especially drug addiction, and the loss of control it entails. The "puppet master" represents the power
                of addiction, which controls and manipulates the person like a puppet. The song also explores the loss
                of autonomy and the internal struggle faced in addiction.

                "...And Justice for All" refers to the Metallica song and album, as well as the Al Pacino film. The
                Metallica song and album are a critique of corruption in the judicial system, while the film is about
                corruption and political pressure within the judicial system, according to Wikipedia.
